# Set of Repositories for DomainModels

**DomainModels** ([Composition Tier 2](http://robmosys.eu/wiki/general_principles:ecosystem:start)) consist of **CommunicationObjects**, **ServiceDefinitions**, **Parameters** and **StateDefinitions**.

**DomainModels** consists of Robotics-Domain-Specific Structures. More precisely, DomainModels structure the particular domains within service robotics. DomainModels are shaped by the experts of these robotics-domains, for example experts from object recognition, from manipulation, or from SLAM. This is a community effort which structures each robotics domain by creating domain-models. Experts working at this level define concrete service definition models, for example a service definition for robot localization.

**DomainModels** are used by **Component** projects as an external dependency.
